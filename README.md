Deep Learning Assignments
This repository contains implementations of various deep learning models and applications using TensorFlow and Keras. The assignments cover topics such as neural networks, computer vision, and natural language processing.

1. Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) in Python using Keras and TensorFlow
Implemented a simple feedforward neural network for binary classification using Keras and TensorFlow. The model is trained on a dataset to classify input data into two categories.

2. Facial Recognition using OpenCV and Deep Learning for Binary Classification
Developed a facial recognition system using OpenCV and a deep learning model for binary classification. The model detects and classifies faces into predefined categories (e.g., authorized or unauthorized).

3. Image Classification using CNNs for Multiclass Classification
Implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) for multiclass classification of images. The model is trained to classify images into multiple categories based on the features it extracts.

4. Time Series Prediction using RNN â€“ Stock Market Analysis or Weather Forecasting
A recurrent neural network (RNN) is used to perform time series prediction, applied to either stock market analysis or weather forecasting. The model learns patterns in historical data to make future predictions.

5. Text Identification using OpenCV, Tesseract (OCR), and Deep Neural Network
This project combines OpenCV and Tesseract OCR to identify and extract text from images. A deep neural network further enhances the text recognition process.

6. Sentiment Analysis using LSTM or GRU Networks
Implemented sentiment analysis on text data using an LSTM or GRU network. The model predicts the sentiment of input text as either positive, negative, or neutral.

7. Object Detection using YOLO and Pretrained Models
Developed an object detection model using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm with a pretrained model. The system identifies and locates objects within images in real-time.
